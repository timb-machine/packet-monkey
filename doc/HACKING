General:

* doc/* exists for a reason, especially doc/ChangeLog
  * Changes should match commit messages, barring mistakes
  * "Bug fix:" should be used to identify minor changes due to
    coding errors
  * doc/ChangeLog should reference filename of changed files
* Quote correctly
  * Use double-quotes, not single-quotes
* Variable names should be descriptive
* Reference variables as ${variablename}
* "printf --" unless you have reason not to
* Avoid unnecessary cats, never use two commands if one will do
* No unnecessary new lines, the only blocks should be those
  introduced by code: if/then/else/fi etc
* Redirects take the form >/path/to/redirect/to (i.e. no space)

lib/misc/*:

* New APIs can be freely added
* Don't read _ if there's a chance the data may be useful later
* Validate your input using lib/misc/validate

lib/filters/*:

* Wherever possible ensure you specify the layer 2/3 protocol
  e.g. udp, tcp minimum, before anything more specific
  * Do similar at layer 4, if the filter might mistakenly match on
    other protools
